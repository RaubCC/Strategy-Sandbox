# Strategy-Sandbox
A sandbox where race strategy meets code. Building Python tools to stress-test pit stops, tyre wear, and race sims — because I don’t just study data, I weaponize it. Mixing engineering grind with a strategist’s instinct to stand out, shine, and prove I belong in the room where the race is decided.

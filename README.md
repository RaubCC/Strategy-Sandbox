# Strategy-Sandbox
A sandbox where race strategy meets code. Building Python tools to stress-test pit stops, tyre wear, and race sims ‚Äî because I don‚Äôt just study data, I weaponize it. Mixing engineering grind with a strategist‚Äôs instinct to stand out, shine, and prove I belong in the room where the race is decided.

# üèéÔ∏è StrategySandbox
A playground for building and testing race strategy + simulation tools in Python.  
Exploring how data, decisions, and pressure shape outcomes in Formula 1.

## Projects so far
- **Pit Stop Strategy Simulator**: Compare 0-stop, 1-stop, 2-stop approaches using tyre degradation + pit loss models.
- (coming soon) **Tire Degradation Models**  
- (coming soon) **Lap Time Prediction with FastF1**

## Skills Used
- Python (lists, tuples, loops, functions, dataclasses)  
- Git/GitHub for version control  
- Numerical methods & basic simulation techniques  

## Goals
- Build a portfolio of race strategy simulations  
- Sharpen coding + analysis skills for motorsport engineering  
- Contribute to long-term career path in Race Strategy
